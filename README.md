# earclip
Polygon to triangle library

Almost all the code was directly copied from https://github.com/mrbaozi/triangulation

I've just wrapped it into a module to make it easier to use.

## Installation

      git clone https://github.com/lionfish0/earclip.git
      cd earclip
      pip install -e .
      
## Usage
